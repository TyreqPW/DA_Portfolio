## Description:
The are 3 CSV files came from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/monkeypox-dataset-daily-updated.
The three files show: 
* Daily confirmed cases within countries worldwide 
* Monkeypox cases worldwide
* Timeline detection of monkeypox cases worldwide

## For my first project, I used two csv files which were the *Daily confirmed cases within countries worldwide* and the *Moneypox cases worldwide.*
